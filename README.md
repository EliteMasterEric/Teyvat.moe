## What is Teyvat.moe?

Teyvat.moe is a free interactive web app for [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/), powered by NextJS, [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html), and community contributions.

The site includes a full, high-resolution in-game map, with options to display markers for the locations as well as routes to assist navigation between them. It includes features to mark items as completed (saving the data in local storage or on Google Drive), as well as a powerful and user-friendly editor to submit new marker collections and routes for the site.

There are easy tools available to allow users to contribute their own markers or routes to the map. See [Contributing](https://github.com/Teyvat-Moe/teyvat.moe/wiki/Contributing) for more information.

This project is open source. [Issues](https://github.com/Teyvat-Moe/teyvat.moe/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Teyvat-Moe/teyvat.moe/pulls) are welcome and highly appreciated.

## Why Teyvat.moe?

There are numerous other interactive maps available, but this map has the edge in the following ways:

-   **Advertisment free**: This site is hosted without advertisements, unlike other apps.
-   **Newest resources mapped**: Plants, monsters, chests, collectibles, and more before other maps.
-   **Community submission process**: If a feature or marker is missing from the map, there is an open review process available to add to it, using a built-in map editor to create an issue here on GitHub. Most other sites have no submission functionality available, or have a process which is undocumented, vague, or confusing.
-   **Multiple Language Support**: The site currently supports a variety of languages. If your language isn't supported or is missing values, [learn how to contribute](https://github.com/Teyvat-Moe/teyvat.moe/wiki/Contributing#how-to-localize-the-site). Most map sites are only available in one or two languages, and some do not support English.
-   **Track progress for free**: The site allows you to flag markers of any type as completed, view progress, locate uncompleted markers, and clear markers as resources respawn. Other sites may only display the markers (without allowing you to check them off), only allow checking off certain markers, or require a 'pro' subscription to save markers.
-   **Synced across devices**: Sign in with Google to sync your progress between multiple devices.
-   **Mobile friendly**: The site officially supports mobile devices and has a custom menu layout for them.
-   **Routes**: The site is includes a dedicated tab for community-created farming routes, overlayed with existing markers.
-   **Free, open-source software**: The project seeks to update its markers frequently, and welcomes community contributions. If the map is missing functionality you want, you can create a fork or pull request. All other known map websites are closed source.

This project was originally a translated mirror of [a Chinese language map](http://www.yuanshen.site/), but later the source code was completely rewritten to facilitate expansion and feature enhancements.
