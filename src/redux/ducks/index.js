/**
 * The state of the application is produced by reducers.
 *
 * The only way to modify the state is to send a signal to the store, known as an action.
 *   When an action is dispatched, the store forwards an action object to the reducer.
 *   The reducer then inspects the type property of the action.
 *   Then, depending on the type, the reducer produces the next state, merging the action payload into the new state.
 *
 * A reducer is a function which takes the current state and an action as arguments.
 *   It then returns a new, modified state as a result.
 *
 * A reducer must be a PURE function.
 *   For a given input state and action, the same resulting state must always be produced.
