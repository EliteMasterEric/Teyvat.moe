 * NOTES:
 *
 * This tutorial was a godsend:
 * https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/#react-redux-tutorial-should-i-use-redux
 *
 * mapStateToProps sets the props of a React component to values from the state.
 * mapDispatchToProps connects Redux actions to react props so a React component can send messages to the store.
 *
 * The goal of Redux should be to move as much application logic as possible out of components,
 * and into middleware. Middleware is reusable, can be tested in isolation, and kept outside the
 *
 * redux-thunk creates a middleware that allows objects to be functions as well as objects.
 * This is useful for any asynchronous data operations.
 * Example: (dispatch) => fetch().then(() => dispatch(action)).
 *
 * redux-saga is a middlware for handling side effects.
 * It relies on generator functions.
