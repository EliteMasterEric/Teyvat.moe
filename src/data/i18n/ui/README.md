### data/i18n

This folder contains JSON files which describe how the site should be translated for users. The website fetches the data from the appropriate JSON file as it loads.

Since the files in this folder are loaded dynamically, you can simply create a new JSON file, whose name is a 2-letter language code to provide the translations for, and the site will pick it up and use it. It will even fetch and display the appropriate flag, if available.

## Formatting

Formatting is done like so:

    {
      bread:"bread",
      butter:"butter",
      question:"I'd like {0} and {1}, or just {0}"
      ...
      login: 'login',
      onlyForMembers: 'You have to {0} in order to use our app',
      bold: 'bold',
      iAmText: 'I am {0} text',
      ...
      january: 'January',
      currentDate: 'The current date is {month} {day}, {year}!'
    }

In code, certain strings in brackets will be replaced with their intended values, like so:

    f('currentDate', {
      month: t('january'),
      day: 12,
      year: 2018
    });

## HTML Tags

Simple HTML can be for many translated strings. Only certain simple tags such as `<b>, <i>, <em>, and <a>` are allowed.

    {
      "contribute": "Click to learn <a href=\"https://github.com/GenshinMap/genshinmap.github.io/wiki/Contributing\">how to contribute.</a>",
    }
