  "map-about-help-content-a": "GenshinMap is an interactive map tool for players of miHoYo's open-world role-playing game, Genshin Impact. It includes <b>{markers} markers</b> and <b>{routes} routes</b>, to help players efficiently collect the resources they need.",
  "map-about-help-content-b": "<b>We are looking for community contributors</b> to help with markers as well as localization! Click to learn <a href=\"https://github.com/GenshinMap/genshinmap.github.io/wiki/Contributing\">how to contribute.</a>",
  
  "map-about-help-content-c": "Click the Features tab above to filter the map to display Oculi, ores, plants, monsters, and more.",
  "map-about-help-content-d": "Double-click a feature marker to flag it as completed. For some features such as chests, a single click will display a popup with more information, including an image or comment.",
  "map-about-help-content-e": "Click the About -> Summary tab to see counts of features you have marked as completed, clear completion on all marked features, clear marks only on features that have respawned (for example, Crystal Chunks have a 72-hour respawn time), or locate a random marker you haven't cleared yet.",
  "map-about-help-content-f": "Click the Routes tab above to filter the map to display community made farming routes, such as ones to efficiently collect regional specialties or fight monsters.",

  "map-editor-help-content-a": "The Editor tool allows users to place markers and routes, add descriptions to them, then submit them via GitHub for official approval and addition to the map. Through this, the map can utilize community contributions to stay consistently up-to-date.",
  "map-editor-help-content-b": "To place a marker, click the Marker button in the map controls on the left side, then click the location where you would like to place the marker. You can cancel marker placement by clicking the Cancel button. To move an existing marker, simply click and drag it.",

You can cancel route placement by clicking the Cancel button.",
  "map-editor-help-content-d": "You can edit elements after they have been placed. To move a marker or the points of a route, simply drag them. Add points to a placed route by dragging the semi-transparent midpoint of a route line. Single click a point on the route to remove it.",
  "map-editor-help-content-e": "You can add a title and description to placed markers; these will display when users click the marker to display a popup. You can also add information to the Media field; paste a link to an image to display it, drag an image from your computer to upload it to Imgur, or paste a YouTube link to embed a video. This will display in the popup when you click the marker, and should ideally provide guidance on how to access the resource if needed.",
  "map-editor-help-content-f": "Once you have completed placing markers for a feature, click the 'Submit Editor Data' at the bottom of the window. You will be directed to fill out a simple form describing the feature's location and category (a feature can only be for one region and one category), then click Confirm.
