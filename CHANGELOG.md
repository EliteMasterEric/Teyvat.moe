# Changelog

# 0.2.0 React Rework

First major release of the rework, featuring a new interface developed in React.

- Most resource types unavailable as markers currently.

# 0.2.1

- Renamed Plants/Animals because the label was too long.
- Added exporters for revised and legacy data.
- Fixed bug where local storage data was being stored improperly.
- Added data for Shrines.

# 0.2.2

- Fixed issue with exporter switching latitude and longitude.

# 0.3.0 Localization Support

- Implemented localization support for interface and all features and routes.
- Marking now displays the timestamp on the popup.
- Revised editor popup to a form.
- Various bug fixes I think.
- Feature data:
  - @Lapis256: Added Mondstadt and Liyue Statues of the Seven.
  - @MasterEric: Added Wei, and stubs for Geo Sigils and Crates.
  - @MasterEric: Imported most chest data from Yuanshen.site.

# 0.4.0 Summary Tab

- Added 'respawn' parameter to feature data JSON to track respawn time.
- Added new Summary subtab under the About tab.
  - This tab displays a progress bar for all features which are currently displayed and have at least one marker complete.
  - It includes an options menu, allowing users to pan to a random uncompleted marker, clear all markers of the feature, or clear the markers which are expired (if the respawn time is configured for that feature).
- Added missing localization for popups.

# 0.4.5 Data Importer

- Reimplemented popups on routes.
- Reworked the Preferences handling.
  - Before this point I've been kinda dumb and making breaking changes to the data format without updating the vesrion, mostly assuming nobody uses the app. This updates locks in GenshinMap Data Version 1. Any future changes to the structure of the DEFAULT_MAP_PREFERENCES must now require updating DataImport.
- Added new data importer. You can now transfer data by exporting a string and importing it.
- Added legacy data importer. You can now transfer data from Yuanshen.site, including chest data!
  - If you were using GenshinMap before the rework, press the Export Legacy Data button, copy that, then paste into the Import Legacy Data dialog.
- Added data migration. If the data format used by the app has changed, it will be imported.
  - If there is an error during this process, a value will be stored in local storage. Recovery functions can be added later as needed.
- New features (currently empty):
  - mondstadtLuminescentSpine
  - liyueLuminescentSpine
  - mondstadtCrystalCore
  - liyueCrystalCore
  - liyueBambooShoot
  - liyueGoldenLoach
- Renamed Wei to [Unusual Hilichurl](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/6526).

# 0.4.10

- Added world border graphic.
  - The boundaries were drawn by hand so they may be slightly off, but not enough to matter.
  - Added option to disable world border graphic.
- Added world region labels for Mondstadt.
  - Liyue labels in progress.
  - Added option to disable world region labels.
- Reworked the editor submission; the data is now put into your clipboard, and you have to paste it in.
  - This is done to prevent a 411 error. There are limits to URL lengths but not to clipboard size (AFAIK).
- Reworked translator rendering to allow simple, safe HTML from some keys.
- Simplified the Help menu's text to include only one contribution link, and bolded it.
- Re-enabled Wei (Mondstadt) in the Feature view.

  - Replaced the current world map graphic in `public/tiles`.

- Reworked state to use React Redux to improve major performance issues.
  - The implementation might not be the best since this is my first project using it, but it's definitely a great learning experience.
  - Seriously that was a big rework, it was like the code equivalent of your basement flooding and having to renovate the entire thing.
  - But it's also the code equivalent of putting a sauna in your basement.
- Reworked preferences handling to use Redux.
  - This updates locks in GenshinMap Data Version 2. Previous versions must be migrated to this one; any future breaking changes (structural changes count, addition of new options does not since defaults will be loaded) require creating a new version.

- Images in the Feature and Route menus now use an intelligent Image component, with lazy loading and placeholder support, for improved page performance.
- Moved attribution element so it is never hidden.

- Will no longer display feature/route categories that contain no elements.
- Will redirect the user to a different feature/route category if they switch tabs or regions and the current category would be empty.
