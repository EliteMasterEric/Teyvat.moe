# Changelog

# 0.2.0 React Rework

First major release of the rework, featuring a new interface developed in React.

-   Most resource types unavailable as markers currently.

# 0.2.1

-   Renamed Plants/Animals because the label was too long.
-   Added exporters for revised and legacy data.
-   Fixed bug where local storage data was being stored improperly.
-   Added data for Shrines.

# 0.2.2

-   Fixed issue with exporter switching latitude and longitude.

# 0.3.0 Localization Support

-   Implemented localization support for interface and all features and routes.
-   Marking now displays the timestamp on the popup.
-   Revised editor popup to a form.
-   Various bug fixes I think.
-   Feature data:
    -   @Lapis256: Added Mondstadt and Liyue Statues of the Seven.
    -   @MasterEric: Added Wei, and stubs for Geo Sigils and Crates.
    -   @MasterEric: Imported most chest data from Yuanshen.site.

# 0.4.0 Summary Tab

-   Added 'respawn' parameter to feature data JSON to track respawn time.
-   Added new Summary subtab under the About tab.
    -   This tab displays a progress bar for all features which are currently displayed and have at least one marker complete.
    -   It includes an options menu, allowing users to pan to a random uncompleted marker, clear all markers of the feature, or clear the markers which are expired (if the respawn time is configured for that feature).
-   Added missing localization for popups.

# 0.4.5 Data Importer

-   Reimplemented popups on routes.
-   Reworked the Preferences handling.
    -   Before this point I've been kinda dumb and making breaking changes to the data format without updating the vesrion, mostly assuming nobody uses the app. This updates locks in GenshinMap Data Version 1. Any future changes to the structure of the DEFAULT_MAP_PREFERENCES must now require updating DataImport.
-   Added new data importer. You can now transfer data by exporting a string and importing it.
-   Added legacy data importer. You can now transfer data from Yuanshen.site, including chest data!
    -   If you were using GenshinMap before the rework, press the Export Legacy Data button, copy that, then paste into the Import Legacy Data dialog.
-   Added data migration. If the data format used by the app has changed, it will be imported.
    -   If there is an error during this process, a value will be stored in local storage. Recovery functions can be added later as needed.
-   New features (currently empty):
    -   mondstadtLuminescentSpine
    -   liyueLuminescentSpine
    -   mondstadtCrystalCore
    -   liyueCrystalCore
    -   liyueBambooShoot
    -   liyueGoldenLoach
-   Renamed Wei to [Unusual Hilichurl](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/6526).

# 0.4.10

-   Added world border graphic.
    -   The boundaries were drawn by hand so they may be slightly off, but not enough to matter.
    -   Added option to disable world border graphic.
-   Added world region labels for Mondstadt.
    -   Liyue labels in progress.
    -   Added option to disable world region labels.
-   Reworked the editor submission; the data is now put into your clipboard, and you have to paste it in.
    -   This is done to prevent a 411 error. There are limits to URL lengths but not to clipboard size (AFAIK).
-   Reworked translator rendering to allow simple, safe HTML from some keys.
-   Simplified the Help menu's text to include only one contribution link, and bolded it.
-   Re-enabled Wei (Mondstadt) in the Feature view.
-   Reworked the world map graphic generator to be much faster and create smaller images.
    -   Replaced the current world map graphic in `public/tiles`.
-   Added a WebP check to the Leaflet map, allowing for use of performant web images.
-   Added new world features (seeking contributions!):
    -   Magical Crystal Chunk (Mondstadt Ore)
    -   Magical Crystal Chunk (Liyue Ore)
    -   Loach Pearl (Liyue Nature)
    -   Bamboo Shoot (Liyue Nature)
-   Map contributions:
    -   @MasterEric: Added several Magical Crystal Chunk locations for Mondstadt and Liyue.
-   Fixed the Bishu Plain Liyue Statue of the Seven rendering off the map.
-   Fixed a bug where the Submit Editor Data form had missing text in the dropdowns.
-   Fixed bug where panning far enough could display parallel universes.
-   Fixed ESLint issues preventing the map from building.

# 0.5.0 Teleporters and Chest Data

-   Imported Liyue chest data from yuanshen.site, mostly manually.

-   Added region labels for Liyue.

-   Replaced all JPG images with PNGs.

-   Removed file extensions from popup images in data files; PNG or WebP will be selected accordingly.

-   Added WebP versions of all images for web performance.

    -   Sadly despite living in 2020 we still have to go in and add WebP handlers to every place images are referenced and include fallbacks and detection code, turning every image tag into a mess of spaghetti code.

-   Optimized all filter and comment images using PNGQuant for better web performance.

-   Fixed a bug where region labels could prevent clicking a marker.

-   Added markers for all 5 world bosses and 3 weekly bosses.

# 0.6.0 Redux Rework

-   Reworked state to use React Redux to improve major performance issues.
    -   The implementation might not be the best since this is my first project using it, but it's definitely a great learning experience.
    -   Seriously that was a big rework, it was like the code equivalent of your basement flooding and having to renovate the entire thing.
    -   But it's also the code equivalent of putting a sauna in your basement.
-   Reworked preferences handling to use Redux.
    -   This updates locks in GenshinMap Data Version 2. Previous versions must be migrated to this one; any future breaking changes (structural changes count, addition of new options does not since defaults will be loaded) require creating a new version.
    -   Users won't have to do anything, as migration can be done from local storage.
-   Images in the Feature and Route menus now use an intelligent Image component, with lazy loading and placeholder support, for improved page performance.
-   Moved attribution element so it is never hidden.
-   The Summary feature menu will now close when you click an option.
-   Marker background is no longer handled by a shadow. This makes markers that are closer together look cleaner (the markers don't overlap).
-   Fixed rendering of route arrows to be browser compatible.
-   Will no longer display feature/route categories that contain no elements.
-   Will redirect the user to a different feature/route category if they switch tabs or regions and the current category would be empty.
-   Revised existing markers:
    -   Removed 2 redundant Wei locations in Liyue (2 markers at same spot)

# 0.6.1 Meteorite Shards

-   Fixed localization not using the proper files.

-   Disabled service worker for now.

-   Memoized many components (as long as their inputs don't change, they don't need to be rerendered).

-   Added schema validation to disallow duplicate markers.

# [ALPHA] 0.10.3 Chest Imports and Route Migration

-   The v0.10.0 versions have been notated as ALPHA versions. Marker data is not currently migrated from older versions of the map which use different IDs for markers. Please test them to ensure proper functionality but be aware that there may be issues if you use these versions to store progress.
-   Map Debug View now includes a text field. Pasting a partial or full marker ID here will locate and navigate to it on the map.
-   Help menu now displays a count of markers and routes in the first paragraph.
-   Fixed a bug causing routes to not render properly.
-   Redid the map graphics to undo an optimization which lowered overall quality at higher zoom levels.
-   Fixed an issue where the map seams were visible on higher zoom levels.
-   JSON files (including I18N and features) have been replaced with JSONC files.
    -   JSONC is a format which is a variant of JSON, which allows for single-line and multi-line comments.
    -   Added a Webpack loader to handle converting these JSONC files to JSON objects.
-   Disabled features due to lack of data.

# [ALPHA] v0.10.4 Data Migration

-   Added user preferences migration to move user completion data to the new marker storage format.
    -   Completion from v0.9 was previously not visible in v0.10.
-   Fixed a bug where the map was using Spherical Mercator projection, causing distances farther from the origin to be skewed.
    -   Apparently the mapping library the site uses defaults to assuming you're displaying a map of Earth, and therefore calculates distances as thought the map were based on a sphere.
    -   This required making a script to realign all the points on the map. If any of them seem skewed, please make an issue requesting a correction.
-   Redid importer for Yuanshen.site to work with new marker storage format.
-   Update the Editor to place markers in MSFv2 format.
    -   Added Description field to Editor Submission.
-   Updated localization files:
    -   meta-page-title-full: Removed [BETA] tag to make the title more concise
    -   popup-submit-editor-data-description:

# 0.10.5 Finalized v0.10 Release

Here is a summary of major changes from v0.10.0-v0.10.4:

-   All Crimson Agates now have text descriptions and YouTube embeds.
-   Imported over 2,500 markers from Yuanshen.site, including chests from Dragonspine.
    -   Note that since Yuanshen.site does not distinguish between chest rarities by default, these still need to be sorted.
-   Markers submitted via the editor are now much easier to add to the main site.
-   Performed some of the backend work required to implement importers for AppSample and MapGenie.
-   Popups now display a switch to enable/disable completion status.
-   Added functionality to convey information to the user via "toast" notifications in the bottom-left corner.
-   Markers and routes can now be navigated to directly via hyperlink.
    -   The feature of the linked marker will be made visible if it isn't already.
    -   Popups now include a button to copy a hyperlink to the clipboard.
-   Added new Map Debug view (available to enable in the options) which displays the coordinates at the cursor.

# 0.10.6 Minor Bug Fixes

-   Fixed an issue that prevented the page from building properly.
-   Fixed an issue that caused the page from displaying as a blank white screen.

# 0.10.7 Changelog Tab and Translations

-   Added a changelog tab to display partial information from this document in the app.
-   Made improvements to error reporting.
    -   The GitHub crash reporter will now attempt to export the user's current preferences and add them to the issue template.
    -   The GitHub crash reporter will now apply a sourcemap to the stack trace, if available
        -   NOTE: Make sure that sourcemaps are available on Netlify. This may require a Webpack change.
    -   These changes should help in the task of replicating and resolving issues.
-   Localization changes:
    -   map-controls-tab-changelog: The name of the Changelog tab in the interface.
-   Imported translations as provided via GitHub:
    -   @Alkmaaar: Translated several Mondstadt features.
    -   @xRitax: Translated Andrius to Japanese.
    -   @luanvilarim: Translated many features to Portuguese.
-   Cleaned up and reformatted feature and route files.
-   Fixed some warnings which appeared in the browser console.
    -   The `MouseEvent.mozPressure is deprecated` issue cannot be resolved and should be ignored. See: <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/3943>
-   Fixed a bug where, in certain languages, some features would display with blank names.

# 0.10.8 More Fixes

-   Editor data is now migrated to MSFv2.
    -   Incremented preferences version to GM_007.
-   Added localization strings:
    -   editor: The name of the Editor.
    -   message-editor-import-success: The popup which appears when importing Editor data.
    -   error-handler-component-message: The message displayed on the Component error handler, where {component} will be replaced with the translated name of the specific component which failed.
-   Fixed an issue where many markers had not had their images imported.
    -   This imports over 300 chest and other images from Yuanshen.site.
-   Hid AppSample and MapGenie importers (they are still in development).
-   Fixed a bug which caused a "can't use useLeafletContext() outside a MapContainer" error.
    -   Ported from NPM to Yarn to allow forcing dependency resolution.
    -   There's a bug which prevents upgrading to berry.
-   Fixed a bug where routes would change color when placed.
    -   This is part of an upcoming feature which will allow recoloring routes.
-   Even more improved error handling and reporting.
    -   Created a component error wrapper, currently applied to the Editor tab of the Map controls. If it crashes, only that part of the UI will display the error handler.
-   Fixed an issue where test markers appeared on the corners of the map.
-   Made additions and modifications to existing markers:
    -   @specklet: Added new images and descriptions for 13 chests around Stormbearer Point.

# 0.11.0 AppSample Migration and Editor QoL Features

-   Added the Sync Data tab, along with an AppSample importer.
    -   Currently supports Crimson Agates (IDs were added in v0.10.0), Anemoculus, and Geoculus, with more coming soon.
    -   Moved the Import Data and Export Data options to the Sync Data tab.
    -   To import from AppSample, navigate to the Sync Data tab and click Migrate from AppSample.
        -   Then, right click the link to create a bookmark to the JavaScript. Then, navigate to the AppSample website, run the bookmarklet, and the data should be added to your clipboard. You can then return to GenshinMap and paste the data to import.
        -   Bookmarklets are sadly the only means to access the user's stored data, since modern web browsers are designed specifically to prevent websites from running JavaScript on other pages for security reasons.
            -   If you're curious or concerned about security, you can read the original source code of the bookmarklets in `scripts/bookmarklets`.
-   Added additional functionality to the editor.
    -   Hold CTRL while playing markers to place additional markers. No more placing markers one at a time!
    -   Hold CTRL while clicking the end of a route to extend the route.
    -   Thanks to Seth Lutske for the help with implementing this.
-   Updated the map graphic for version 1.3.0.
    -   Updated the mountain behind Tianqiu Valley where the Primo Geovishap resides.
    -   Added skipped changes to the Golden House area.
    -   Changed the area south of Dunyu Ruins and in the pass north of Mt. Tianheng.
-   Updated the world border for version 1.3.0
    -   Fixed an issue where the world border was accidentally made jagged and square.
-   Reworked the localization files.
    -   I kept experiencing places where I had to add more localization keys to add more content, or rename existing localization keys since they have been previously based on some context. Thus, I took the plunge and renamed a large number of localization keys in this update.
    -   The contents of the Help tabs are now in a single keys containing `\n` to split paragraphs.
    -   The names of keys that don't depend on a specific context (like `options-import-button: Import`) have been given more generic names (`import: Import`) that describe content rather than context, so they can more easily be moved around and reused.
    -   Added some new localization keys.
    -   I will update all of these on POEditor soon.
-   Fixed the category buttons in the feature/route tabs not using Material components.
-   Updated the following features:
    -   Geovishap (Liyue): Added 6 locations.
    -   Primo Geovishap: Added 1 location. Updated description.
    -   Childe (Liyue): Tweaked position and updated description.
    -   Pyro Regisvine (Liyue): Tweaked position and updated description.
    -   Oceanid (Liyue): Tweaked position and updated description.
    -   Geo Hypostasis (Liyue): Tweaked position and updated description.

    -   Anemo Hypostasis (Mondstadt): Tweaked position and updated description.
    -   Electro Hypostasis (Mondstadt): Tweaked position and updated description.
    -   Anemoculus: Added AppSample importer IDs.
    -   Crimson Agate: Updated invalid AppSample IDs on 8 markers.
    -   Geoculus: Added AppSample importer IDs, and fixed one video link.
    -   Fatui Pyro Agent (Liyue): Added a description for an annoying location in Mingyun Village.
    -   Domain (Mondstadt): Cleaned up the positions to be more accurate.
    -   Statue of the Seven (Mondstadt): Cleaned up the positions to be more accurate.
-   Removed the "Cluster Markers" option from the editor submission form.
-   Fixed a bug where removing a vector from a route would not be committed.
-   Fixed a bug where route vectors would have the wrong decimal precision.
-   Fixed a bug where opening a marker popup would reset the completion time.
-   Fixed a bug where the editor would output bad coordinates.
-   Fixed a bug where the editor would switch to an invalid tab when clearing the editor data.
-   Fixed a bug where anchors would shift a bit visually at further zoom levels. The tip of the anchor now points at the marker's exact location at all zoom levels.

# 0.11.1 Chest Cleanup and Bug Fixes

-   Updated the following features:
    -   Illumiscreen (Liyue): Added 6 Lantern Rite Event Chests.
    -   Snowboar King (Dragonspine): Added 1 location.
    -   Common Chest (Dragonspine): Used Chinese translation to move 142 markers to Exquisite/Precious/Luxurious.
    -   Exquisite Chest (Dragonspine): Moved 104 markers from Common Chest (Dragonspine).
    -   Precious Chest (Dragonspine): Moved 37 markers from Common Chest (Dragonspine).

-   Fixed an issue where the Japanese language would not be properly recognized by browser locale detection.
-   Fixed an issue where Dragonspine displayed Electro Cicin Mages rather than Cryo Cicin Mages.
-   Removed JSONC handler.

# 0.11.2 Tiny Fix

-   Remove Geoculus (TEST) feature.
-   Fixed a bug where markers would display a PNG image instead of a WebP image.

# 0.12.1 Major Site Overhauls

-   This update took over a month to get out, but for good reason. I've been working on a lot of sweeping changes to optimize the site and the dev build was not functional for large swaths of that time.
-   Migrated the entire project to TypeScript, and refactored a lot of code to account for issues.
    -   This took like a month to do but I think it was worthwhile. Every place where Typescript validates input values means fewer bugs and improved stability.
    -   Hopefully I can go another couple months without refactoring the entire app again.
-   Migrated the entire project to NextJS.
    -   This provides benefits such as automatic WebP optimization and improved Webpack bundling (which allows for asynchronous loading of language data!).
    -   Split feature and route JSON data into two bundles so they are fetched only after page load.
    -   Split non-English language and changelog JSON data into their own JSON data bundles so they are only fetched when the client requests them.
    -   Split dev-only validation into a separate bundle such that it isn't loaded in production.
    -   Switched from react-world-flags to svg-country-flags and reworked logic to improve tree shaking. This change alone saved about a megabyte in page size.
-   Reworked internal state storage to use Redux Toolkit. It is now more structured and easier to maintain.
-   Improved performance when showing or hiding features.
-   Removed attribution link in the bottom left corner.

# 0.12.2 Yuanshen Import

-   Imported 2,458 markers from Yuanshen.site (Fetched on April 6, 2021).

    -   All map labels.
    -   Almost all feature names.
    -   Most feature descriptions.
    -   Some marker popup titles and descriptions.
-   Added new attributes to the Marker Storage Format.
    -   Any localized text attribute may now include the \_code property. These values optional values correspond to the TextMap file in Dimbreath's repo and are used to automatically populate the required values.
    -   Any marker may now include the optional `tags` attribute. These correspond to the tags in the `src/data/core/tags.json` file. This is currently only stored in JSON data, but in future updates this will be used to power a marker filtering feature.
-   Removed `webp` files, as these are auto-generated by NextJS.
